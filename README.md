# London-Boroughs
The description and motivation for this project can be found in the .html file available in the repository. This is a cleaner version of some EDA I did a while ago on the same data set. This one focuses in particular on the borough of Newham, with visualizations of its population density, population, and population growth against the other boroughs present in London. 

Just open the RProj file in RStudio and you should be good to go.
